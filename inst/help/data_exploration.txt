1	#matrixOutput	The correlation matrix shows all correlation between variables that share a subset of nPOD cases. The data come from many small-scale independent experiments mostly focused on different questions. Nevetheless, a measurement from one investigation can show an interesting relationship with another in a separate investigation. <strong>Click on a cell to see the underlying data points.</strong>	right
2	#drilldownOutput	<strong>This portal drills down to the individual-level data for a variable/relationship of interest.</strong> Either one-dimensional or two-dimension variable views are available. Alongside exploratory interaction with the correlationship matrix, use the select menu for more specific access to underlying data.	left
3	#matrixCtrlUI	<strong>Use these filters to control what is shown in the correlation matrix.</strong> Set a more stringent sample size (larger shared subset of nPOD cases) for displaying correlations, or focus on other attributes. Additional data annotations allow for more filtering methods. For example, choose filter by “cell/tissue origin” to see options in the selection menu as well as in the visual search map.	bottom
4	#cor-upload-dataUploadUI	Data can tell a better story when placed in the bigger picture. If you have new data (or even old unpublished data), running a comparison against the cumulative database can: <li>help support results (by showing that yours are consistent with other similar data )</li> <li>reveal unexpected connections (a strong correlation with a very different variable measured elsewhere) that lead to new hypotheses</li><li>give you a better sense of how your data contributes in the history of nPOD</li><br>Note that this does depend on whether there is a large enough overlapping subset of nPOD cases. The dividends of this tool will increase as more investigators contribute data and coverage across nPOD cases. <strong>Click “Next” to simulate an example upload.</strong>	bottom
