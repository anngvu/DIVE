**What kind of data?**

You are uploading *nPOD* non-high-throughput numeric data. For high-throughput, image, or other complex data, please contact us or go to (OFFICIAL PROCESS TBD). For non-nPOD data comparisons, you may be intested in the Cohort Exchange.

**Format**

The table should have a first column named 'ID' with *nPOD* case IDs, which we use as the key for joining data. If there is no ID column, the upload will not proceed.

**Data confidentiality**

Note that this DOES NOT automatically save your data within our server. To officially contribute your data, go to (OFFICIAL PROCESS TBD)
