1	#cohortGraph	<strong>The nPOD graph (a hybrid parallel coordinates plot) provides a quick visual summary of nPOD resources and the covariate data made available for matching.</strong> The covariates include standard demographic and clinical variables such as age, sex and BMI, and ones of special interest to diabetes/autoimmune disease research such as autoantibody combination/count and HLA risk scores (coming soon). Note that covariates with more missing data work less well for matching. Hovering on a node of a categorical axis gives an additional breakdown of cohort composition. Overall, the graph is meant to give an idea of the capabilities and limitations of matching using the nPOD cohort. Click “Next” to see how this works with example data.	bottom
2	#newDatasetInput	To serve and promote collaboration with diabetes researchers outside of nPOD, the cohort matching tool provides an easy interface to match an external independent cohort (“CohortX”) with nPOD, but it can also be used to match nPOD cases internally (make sure the checkbox on the right is unchecked). <strong>The match session starts when cohort data (which needs to be prepared as described in “data requirements”) is uploaded.</strong> For this demo we will use the dataset <code>ExampleCohort2020</code>, which combines actual T1D cases from the DiViD and UK cohorts previously described in <a href=’https://doi.org/10.2337/db14-1370’>[1]</a> and <a href=’https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14896’>[2]</a>, respectively.	auto
3	#refSubsetInput	<strong>After uploading cohort data, the first parameter to specify is the type of nPOD matches desired.</strong> Options correspond to use cases such as: 1) you have a set of T1D cases and would like non-diabetic matches from the nPOD pool to represent <em>negative controls</em>, 2) you have a set of T1D cases and would like to get nPOD T1D matches to represent <em>positive controls or a validation cohort</em>, 3) you have have a set of cases with another autoimmune disease and would like matched T1D cases to explore common pathways. The demo is based on the second use case, so change the selection to “T1D” before proceeding.	right
4	#matchLinkUI	<strong>The match parameters UI allows intuitive user setting of how two cohort datasets should be harmonized and parameterized for matching.</strong> The selection necessarily depends on the use case determined in the last step. In this demo, use the UI to select “Age” and “Sex”, then click MATCH.	right
5	#matchResultOutput	<strong>The main result of matching is shown here.</strong> The full table of match results can be downloaded using the “Export” button. Navigate to the other tab to see summary statistics. Click “Next” to learn about advanced exploration.	top
6	#matchResultOutput	nPOD cases have been richly characterized, and though these other attributes are not considered covariates for matching, investigators can explore the partial data. For “comparable” attributes that capture the same or nearly the same concept/process but were not measured with the same scale or method, the cohorts are compared side by side in separate plots. <strong>Select the attribute “” in CohortX to see this example.</strong>	top
7	#exploreMoreUI	It is possible that the data are already on the same scale or can be transformed to be on the same scale using a mapping or normalization function. For example, “HLA Risk” is. Check “Plot on same scale” and enter in “ “. This will be applied on CohortX data values.	top
