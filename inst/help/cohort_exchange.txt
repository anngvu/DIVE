1	#cohortGraph	<strong>The nPOD graph (a hybrid parallel coordinates plot) provides a quick visual summary of nPOD resources and the covariate data made available for matching.</strong> The covariates include standard demographic and clinical variables such as age, sex and BMI, and ones of special interest to diabetes/autoimmune disease research such as autoantibody combination/count and HLA risk scores (coming soon). Note that covariates with more missing data work less well for matching. Hover on a node of a categorical axis to see an additional breakdown of cohort composition. Overall, the graph is meant to give an idea of the capabilities and limitations of matching using the nPOD cohort. Click <em>Next</em> to see how this works with example data.	auto
2	#newDatasetInput	<strong>To serve and promote collaboration with diabetes researchers <em>outside</em> of nPOD, the cohort matching tool provides an easy interface to compare and match an external independent cohort (“CohortX”) with the nPOD cohort. It can also be used to match nPOD cases internally (make sure the checkbox on the right is unchecked).</strong> The match session starts when cohort data (which needs to be prepared as described in “data requirements”) is uploaded. For this demo we will use the dataset <code>ExampleCohort2020</code>, which combines actual T1D cases from the DiViD and UK cohorts previously described in <a href=’https://doi.org/10.2337/db14-1370’>[1]</a> and <a href=’https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14896’>[2]</a>, respectively.	auto
3	#refSubsetInput	<strong>The parameters interface will initialize after data is uploaded; here you should first specify the type of nPOD matches desired.</strong> For example, in one use case you have a set of T1D cases and would like no-diabetes matches from the nPOD pool to represent <em>negative controls</em>. In another case, you might have a set of T1D cases and would like to get nPOD T1D matches to represent <em>positive controls or a validation cohort</em>. In this case, you can select the main T1D group and optionally  include T1D-Medalist, depending on the age/disease duration range of your own cohort. Finally, nPOD does contain T2D, Auto-antibody Positive donors, and smaller groups of other types (which may be useful to see how T1D uniquely compares to these other groups).  Make a selection for the first or second use case before proceeding.	auto
4	#matchLinkUI	<strong>If you are interested in exchanging cohorts, the match parameters UI allows intuitive user setting of how two cohort datasets should be harmonized and parameterized for matching. But this is purely optional, and you can go straight to exploring and comparing cohort data attributes if that is all you want to do</strong> Do not implement matching yet – we will return to this step. 	auto
5	#exploreMoreUI	<strong>Explore cohort attributes without matching</strong> Each drop-down menu contains attributes available for the labeled cohort. You will see that the selection interface changes after you have implemented matching.	top
6	#matchLinkUI	<strong>In the match parameters UI, you are provided with a drag-and-drop interface to specify the variables/attributes that will be used for matching</strong> For example, if there is an Age variable in your dataset, pairing it with an Age variable in nPOD will include it in the matching model. An attribute by any other name in your dataset can be used for matching if it is truly the same (type of measurement, scale, etc.), and you should consult the nPOD data documentation to make sure. For certain special attributes, such as HLA risk scores, we have tools that might make them available for your cohort <strong>coming soon</strong>. Note that the parameters also necessarily depends on the use case determined previously. For example, if you had chosen No-diabetes nPOD donors, it would not make sense to try to matching on auto-antibody positivity. As of now you can only get one 1:1 matches (CohortX:nPOD). In the future, if your cohort is small and as our nPOD cohort grows, we may be able to implement a 1:2 ratio. To proceed, test out the drag-and-drop UI and click <strong>GET MATCHES</strong>.	top
7	#matchResultOutput	<strong>If the match was successful, you will see a preview of the match table.</strong> The full table of match results can be downloaded to a .csv file. You can always go back to Match parameters to modify your selection, re-run a match and get different results. After matching, you can also explore cohort data more meaningfully.	top
8	#exploreMoreUI	<strong>After matching, the matched attributes can automatically be compared on the same plot, and you can visualize the specific cases that have been matched.</strong> Unmatched attributes are are still compared in separate plots.	top
9	#exploreMoreUI	<strong>TO DO: What if you want to visualize attributes as if they were matched, without actually including them in the match model? If you want to transform certain attributes so they can be compared on the same scale, the “Mapping function” tool allows you to apply this.</strong>	top
