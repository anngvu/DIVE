'Get from original source' link points to the original data in a supplemental file or to an external database where data has been deposited. The original sources can provide more detail about methodology, definitions and other metadata, but are in a variety of formats not universally machine-readable (e.g. PDF, Excel). To facililate re-use, curated data can also be downloaded all at once (except for some high-throughput datasets) as a collection of plain text tab-delimited  files.
