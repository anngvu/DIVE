**How do I use the query field?**

We use the [mygene.info](http://mygene.info/) API to map annotations, i.e. from ontologies, and other information to the data to make it more searchable/filterable. 
The quick-start examples below demonstrates supported queries.


Example query text      | Result
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`tumor suppressor`      | Search everything; get any genes/proteins that matches query.
`name:insulin`          | Search by gene name.
`GO:0030070`            | Get all genes/proteins annotated with the Gene Ontology term [insulin processing](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030070)
`refseq:NM_001798`      | Get the gene/protein corresponding to the RNA sequence.
`refseq:NP_439892`      | Get the gene/protein corresponding to the protein sequence.
`chrX:151,073,054-151,383,976` | Get all genes/proteins within this chrX interval (use with or without commas). However, note that `chrX` is not recognized as a valid query to retrieva all genes on Chromosome X.

You can use AND/OR/NOT boolean operators and grouping to form complicated queries:

Example query text                       | Operator/grouping
-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`tumor AND suppressor`                   | AND operator
`CDK2 OR BTK`                            | OR operator
`"tumor suppressor" NOT receptor`        | NOT operator
`(interleukin OR insulin) AND receptor`  | grouping with parentheses
