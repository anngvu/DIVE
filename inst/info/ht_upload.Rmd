###### What kind of data?

Currently, you can upload high-throughput _or_ low-throughput clinical/experimental data. In fact, doing both will get the most out of this tool.

For high-throughput data we currently support gene expression, protein expression, or other expression data (e.g. metabolomics) that can be represented as a normalized expression/counts matrix, where columns contain case sample IDs and rows are preferably mapped to Entrez gene IDs. In the future we may be able to expand visualization capabilities to methylation data and others. If high-throughput data is uploaded successfully, you will be able to select it from the **Available datasets** menu.

For clinical/experimental data, there should be a column named "ID" containing case sample IDs, and the other column(s) containining measurements. Whether you have uploaded high-throughput or low-throughput data will be inferred using the presence of the "ID" column. If low-throughput data is uploaded successfully, you will then be able to search for it from the **Phenotype/Experimental variable(s)** menu.

This *DOES NOT* automatically save your data.
