**Please note that the GEO import functionality is still in beta.**

Sourcing from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) is possible for limited types of datasets: gene expression (microarray, RNA-seq) and protein expression. The accession must have data as the standardized matrix file not exceeding the size limit.
