Canzano18_1	Morphometric analyses of islet and exocrine microvascular networks for vessel diameters, densities, and areas and SMA areas	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Canzano et al. (2018)		Multiplex immunofluorescence was conducted using 4 primary antibodies to detect all neuroendocrine cells: secretogranin 3 (SCG3), beta-cells (insulin), vascular endothelium (CD34, CD31), and SMA. Endocrine and exocrine vessel morphometric analyses were performed using custom Python scripts. Total islet area was identified by thresholding the SCG3+ area and applying morphological filters to acquire a smoothed islet boundary to include all SCG3+, CD34+, and SMA+ areas (Fig. 1). Islets were categorized for insulin immunopositivity (INS+/–) using a background-corrected insulin intensity and visual confirmation for every islet. Islet CD34+ area (%), insulin area (%), and SMA+ area (%) were determined via thresholding of the immunostained area divided by total islet area. Particle analysis was used to determine CD34+ islet vessel density (vessels/μm2 islet area) based on previously described methods for individual vessel counts and area (%).29 The plug-in Geodesic Diameters was used to determine vessel diameters via maximum inscribed circles for each vessel, and average vessel diameter was determined for each islet.30 Similar calculations were performed in the same image field for the peri-islet exocrine microvasculature excluding islets and major vessels and ducts.
Simeonovic18_1	Quantitative analyses of HS, HSPGs, insulin and glucagon localization	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Simeonovic et al. (2012)		For quantitative analyses of HS, HSPGs, insulin and glucagon localization in human islets, paraffin sections (4 μm thickness) of nPOD human pancreases and isolated human islets fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or by immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval for HS and Col18 was performed using 0.05% pronase (Calbiochem, Japan) [27, 28], whereas heat/citrate buffer (pH 6) was used for Sdc1 and heparanase [27, 28].

DNA was purified using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Valencia, CA).
Bogdani14_4	Histologic grading of exocrine pancreas pathology	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Bogdani et al. (2014)		To evaluate the severity of histopathological changes in the CF exocrine pancreas, we used a grading system (1 to 5) (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Fig. S10), based on the scoring system previously used for human chronic pancreatitis50. For completeness, quantification of the loss of chymotrypsin-positive (CHYM) acinar cells and the presence of ductal-like structures (dilated acini lined by atrophic acinar cells)51 were added. Fibrosis was evaluated as perilobular, intralobular and periacinar. Perilobular fibrosis was defined as fibrotic thickening of pancreatic interlobular septa. Intralobular fibrosis, as fibrotic strands that extended from the thickened interlobular septa into the pancreatic lobules and surrounded clusters of acini. Periacinar fibrosis was defined as fibrotic thickening of periacinar basement membranes. Loss of acinar parenchyma was assessed by the relative chymotrypsin-positive (CHYM) tissue area. Grade N (normal) was assigned to normal pancreas tissues without any detectable lesions and included: absence of fibrosis, acinar parenchyma occupying >95% of the pancreas tissue area, absence of duct-like structures, and absence of pancreatic duct dilation.  
Kusmartseva17_1	Quantification of CD45+, CD68+ and Ki67+, insulin+ and dual Ki67+/insulin+ cells 	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Kusmartseva et al. (2017)		Each pancreas received was divided into a head, body and tail region, each of which was subjected to serial transverse sectioning. Within each region, tissue pieces were consecutively and alternately used for preparation of both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and frozen tissue blocks. Three consecutive paraffin sections were cut at 4 µm from one representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue block within each region. All sections were deparaffinised and rehydrated with serial passage through changes of xylene and graded ethanol. All slides were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval in Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The tissue sections were double stained for insulin (polyclonal guinea pig anti-insulin,1:2000 dilution; catalogue no. A0564, RRID:AB_10013624; Dako) and one of the following markers: CD68 for macrophages (monoclonal mouse anti-CD68, 1:2000 dilution; catalogue no. M0814, RRID:AB_2314148; Dako); CD45 for leucocytes (monoclonal mouse anti-CD45, 1:200 dilution; catalogue no.

Primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-NPY (1:2,000, Peninsula Laboratories T-4070); rabbit anti-PYY (1:5,000; Abcam ab131246); mouse anti-glucagon (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich G2654-.2ML); rabbit anti-glucagon (1:500, Immunostar 20076); guinea pig anti-insulin (1:200, Dako A0564); rat anti-somatostatin (1:300, EMD Millipore MAB354); goat anti-PP (1:150, Everest Biotech EB06805); rat anti-ghrelin (1:50, R&D Systems MAB8200); mouse anti-Nkx6.1 (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank F55A1-0S); mouse anti-Pdx1(1:200, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank F109-D12-S); rabbit anti-MafA (1:500, Bethyl Laboratories A300-611A); mouse anti-Ki67 (1:50, BD Biosciences 550609); Mcm2 (1:500, BD Biosciences 610701); and chicken anti-GFP (1:250, Aves Labs Inc. 1020). Donkey- and goat-derived secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC, Cy3, Cy5, Alexa 448, and Alexa 647 were diluted 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). MafA and NPY coimmunostaining was performed by using a protocol for using two antibodies raised in the same species (55).  Slides were viewed using a Leica DM6000 microscope (Leica Microsystems), and images were acquired using Openlab software (Improvision). To measure NPY+ β cells, all islets were imaged across pancreatic sections immunostained for insulin and NPY. The total number of insulin+ and NPY+ cells was manually counted, along with cells positive for both NPY and insulin. The data are expressed as the percentage of total β cells. Ki67 and Mcm2 were used as markers of replication in NPY+ and NPY– β cells. Pancreatic sections immunostained for insulin, NPY, and Ki67 or Mcm2 were imaged (3–5 animals per group; 3 sections per animal; all β cells counted). The number of β cells positive or negative for NPY expression was quantified. The number of Ki67+ or Mcm2+ and Ki67– or Mcm2– cells in both these β cell subpopulations was then determined by manually counting. The data for NPY+Ins+Ki67+ or Mcm2+ and NPY–Ins+Ki67+ or Mcm2+ cells was expressed as a percentage of NPY+ and NPY– β cells, respectively. β Cell mass was measured according to published protocols (54).

Martin17_1	Immunostaining for nitrotyrosine	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Martin et al. (2017)		In the current procedure, sections (5 μm) from the pancreatic tail of various cases (see Table 1 for case description) were de-paraffinized with xylene, rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol, immersed in water and subjected to antigen retrieval with citrate buffer, pH 6, containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). During immunohistochemistry, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) was employed as a wash buffer. Following antigen retrieval, sections were soaked for 30 min in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) on ice and then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; catalogue number 06-284), diluted 1:500 (equivalent to a working concentration of 0.9 μg IgG/ml) in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20. Following washing, sections were reacted with highly-cross-absorbed species-specific donkey anti-rabbit IgG biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove, PA, USA; catalogue number 711-066-152, dilution 1:200 in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h at 37 °C. Sections were finally incubated with streptavidin-Alexa 568 (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR; catalogue number S11226, dilution 1:800 in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum) for a further 1 h at 37 °C. As a negative control, anti-nitrotyrosine was replaced with diluent in the immunohistochemical procedure. To confirm the immunohistochemical specificity of rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine employed in this study, formalin-fixed sections of rat cerebellum (known to express nitrotyrosine in Purkinje cells) were immunostained with rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine as above.  Following nitrotyrosine immunostaining, pancreatic sections from various cases were incubated with guinea pig anti-insulin serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; catalogue number A0564, dilution 1:600 in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum) followed by reaction with donkey anti-guinea pig IgG-Alexa 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, dilution 1:400 in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum). Sections were then viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) under epifluorescence, and digital images of both nitrotyrosine and insulin positivity were recorded. In each dual-stained section, islets positive for insulin with and without co-staining for nitrotyrosine were identified and enumerated. The percentage of insulin-positive islets co-expressing nitrotyrosine was then calculated for each case.
RodriguezCalvo17_1	Quantification of islet and islet cells	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Rodriguez-Calvo et al. (2017)		Pancreas sections were stained for insulin, proinsulin, and glucagon after a standard triple indirect immunofluorescence staining.

Staining was performed using a polyclonal guinea pig anti-insulin antibody (1:500; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-proinsulin (DSHB clone GS-9A8, 1:50), and monoclonal mouse anti-glucagon (clone K79bB10, 1:300; Abcam) conjugated in-house to Alexa Fluor 647. Secondary antibodies included F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-guinea pig IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:800; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (1:1,000; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Sections were counterstained with Hoechst (1:400; Life Technologies) for 10 min and then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies).  Image Acquisition and Analysis Sections were scanned with an Axio Scan Z.1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY) using a fluorescent Orca Flash 4.0 v2 (HXP 120 V lamp) camera with a ×20/0.8 NA objective for immunofluorescence. Images were acquired with ZEN2 software slidescan module. Acquisition settings were kept constant between specimens to allow for quantitative comparison between samples. ZEN2 software blue edition was used to process the images before analysis. Lower and upper thresholds were defined for each channel. For insulin and proinsulin, similar thresholds were set for comparison. Then, whole-tissue section images were exported and reduced at 30% or 45%, depending on their size, into .tiff files for automatic software analysis. Custom macros were developed to measure tissue area (macro 1) and islet size and count (macro 2) and calculate the percentage of insulin, proinsulin, and glucagon areas (macro 3; only cytoplasmic staining above background levels was measured). To classify and calculate the number of α- and β-cells, the image of the whole tissue section was exported into 20 × 20 .tiff files to improve resolution and then processed by a different custom macro (macro 4) (Supplementary Fig. 1). All of the macros were developed for Fiji, an image-processing software program developed for ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). R software was used to systematically analyze the data (R is available as free software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form). In addition, three cases per group were analyzed by high-resolution confocal microscopy using an LSM 880 confocal microscope with Airyscan technology (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and a ×63 objective.
Graves16_1	Expression of lineage markers	flow cytrometry assay	Graves et al. (2016)		Cryopreserved intestinal immune cells were thawed from liquid nitrogen at 37°C, washed, and suspended in PBS prior to incubation with a fixable Live/Dead Yellow viability dye (Life Technologies) for 10 min at RT. Following Fc receptor blocking (Human TruStain FcX™, BioLegend), surface staining was performed in FACS buffer [PBS, 1% FBS, 4 mM EDTA, and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B)] interrogating expression of lineage markers (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20), CD56, CD127, CD117, NKp44, CD45, CD3, αβ TCR, γδ TCR, CD4, CD8, CCR6, CXCR3 (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Intracellular staining for FOXP3 and HELIOS was performed using FOXP3 Fix/Perm Buffer Set (BioLegend). All antibodies were used at manufacturer-recommended concentrations. Fluorescence minus one or isotype controls were used as indicated. Data were acquired using a BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo data analysis software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA). All data were normalized to 1,000,000 total cells collected in the lymphocyte gate and are presented as frequencies and total cell numbers.
Graves16_2	Soluble mediator analysis	ELISA	Graves et al. (2016)		Reverse transcription and RT-qPCR was performed according to MIQE guidelines (18). Synthesis of cDNA was performed using SuperScript® Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies), whereby RT-qPCR was performed using primer sets (Table S2 in Supplementary Material), and SsoAdvanced™ SYBR Green Supermix was used according to manufacturer recommendations. Data were collected and analyzed using CFX Connect™ and CFX Manager™ (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA) according to the ddCT algorithm using 18S as a reference gene and are presented as fold change. ELISA technology (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was used according to manufacturer protocol to assess whole tissue and primary IEC production of interleukin 10 (IL-10). Data were analyzed using a standard curve, positive, and negative control. For whole tissue expression, all data were normalized to total protein, while media-only levels were subtracted from primary IEC expression, which was normalized to 18S RNA levels from each primary cell culture.
Graves16_3	Histopathological assessment	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Graves et al. (2016)		Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of duodenum from all cases were obtained from nPOD and blindly evaluated by an experienced histopathologist (Jian Li) according to Marsh–Oberhuber classification (19) (Table S4 in Supplementary Material). Additional 5 µm sectioned slides of duodenum from all cases were used to assess goblet cell frequency by Periodic-acid Schiff staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer protocol.

Babon16_1	Detection of autoreactivity in CD4+ lymphocytes	assay detecting IFN-gamma production	Babon et al. (2016)		(Note: CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines and clones sorted or directly grown from islets from donors with T1D) CD4+ T cell lines and clones were tested for peptide reactivity by pulsing irradiated B cells with peptides (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and then washing. In addition, irradiated parent Priess and autoan-tigen-expressing Priess B cells were used as APCs (Fig. 2f–i). For both peptide-pulsed B cell and autoantigen-transduced B cell as antigen-presenting cell experiments, B cells were plated at 7.5–10 × 103 cells/well with 2.5 × 104 T cells in triplicate wells of round-bottom 96-well plates (CoStar). After culture for 48–72 h, supernatants were collected and IFN-γ was detected by standard ELISA (BD BioSciences). After one or two rounds of stimulation, reactivity of the T cell lines was re-tested and cytokine secretion was analyzed by Luminex (MILLIPLEX MAP Human Th17 Magnetic Bead Kit). Blocking anti-HLA-DR (L243, BD BioSciences) or anti-HLA-DQ (SPV-L3, Abcam) was added in some experiments (antibodies at 20 μg/ml) to confirm HLA restriction.
Babon16_2	Detection of autoreactivity in CD8+ lymphocytes	flow cytometry assay	Babon et al. (2016)		(Note: CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines and clones sorted or directly grown from islets from donors with T1D) For detection of CD8+ T cell autoreactivity, CD8+ T cell lines were treated with dasatinib40, stained with Zombie Violet and either with pools of HLA-A2 pentamers (ProImmune) loaded with insulin B chain10–18, IA-2797–805, IGRP265–273 or pre-proinsulin15–24, GAD65114–123, IAPP5–13 multimers3 or individually, with malaria circumsporozoite protein319–327 as a negative control and gates were drawn on the basis of this staining. Events were detected by flow cytometry (LSRII, Becton Dickinson).
Richardson16_1	HLA expression quantification	microarray assay	Wu et al. (2012)		Using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST array, CEL files were generated from both control and type 1 diabetic donors, as previously described [24]. Raw signal-intensity values from Affymetrix spike-in controls demonstrated that array hybridisation had been successful (i.e. bioB<bioC<bioD<Cre). Data quality was verified by measuring the positive vs negative area under the curve. Raw signal-intensity values from all arrays were robust multichip average background corrected, quantile normalised, median polish summarised and log2 transformed [25–27]. NetAffx-determined probe-set annotations for HLA genes (Affymetrix) were re-mapped according to RefSeq, release 73 (15 November 2015; see ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/archive/). For each HLA gene, where multiple mappings were possible (i.e. HLA-A, -B, -C and -F), probe sets were annotated according to eight major haplotypes incorporated into the human genome assembly, as previously described [28]. Because probe sets shared mappings, it was not possible to identify HLA subtypes uniquely using this gene chip; rather, transcript clusters were used to examine changes in global gene expression. Processing was carried out using the Partek Genomics Suite, version 6.5 (Partek, St Louis, MO, USA).

Phelps16_1	GAD65 ratio calculation	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Phelps et al. (2016)		The ratio of GAD65 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the Golgi compartment and post-Golgi vesicles compared with the rest of the cytosol was calculated with a custom ImageJ macro. Individual B-cells in a given field of view were identified and outlined by hand. For each cell, the macro automatically defined a region of interest (ROI) outlining the Golgi compartment, identified by giantin costain or by characteristic morphology and brightness thresholding of GAD65 stain, and GAD65+ vesicles, identified by brightness thresholding of GAD65+ bright puncta. A second ROI defined the remainder of the cell, excluding the Golgi, GAD65+ vesicles, and nucleus. GAD65 Golgi accumulation was reported as the ratio of MFI for the two ROIs.
Helman16_1	Staining and quantificationof p16, pS6 and mitochondrial markers 	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Helman et al. (2016)		To determine expression levels of p16, pS6 and mitochondrial markers in stained islet sections of human subjects, we used the NIS-Elements software (Nikon) to measure the mean intensity per section area of the fluorescent signal within islets and divided it by the mean intensity per area of the signal in the surrounding acinar tissue in the same field to account for differential staining background. >10 islets per subject were scored. For beta cell area determination, we stained paraffin-embedded tissue sections 50 μm apart, spanning the entire pancreas, for insulin and hematoxylin. 40× magnification images were obtained and merged, and the fraction of tissue stained for insulin was determined using NIS-Elements software.
Liu16_1	Proteomics	liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	Liu et al. (2016)		Approximately 30 mg of tissue from each sample were processed for TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS was used for peptide analysis.
Arif14_1	Immune cell quantification	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Arif et al. (2014)		Pancreas sections from the DiViD and nPOD collections were examined by a combination of immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry using horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase staining, as appropriate. Where possible, and to minimize sample usage, at least two antigens per section were examined in parallel. Antigens were unmasked by heat-induced epitope retrieval (20 min at full power in a microwave oven; 800 W) in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6). Combined staining was achieved by using guinea pig anti-insulin (A0564; Dako) in combination with mouse anti-glucagon (ab10988; Abcam) and visualized using a Vector Red Substrate kit for detection of alkaline phosphatase activity (AK-5100 and SK-5100; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, U.K.). Binding of rabbit anti-CD8 and mouse anti-CD20 sera was visualized using secondary antibodies tagged with appropriate fluorescent probes (Alexa Fluor anti-mouse 488 [A11029; Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.] or anti-rabbit 568 [A1136; Invitrogen]). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI.
CampbellThompson16_1	Insulitic islet screening	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2016)		Multiple slide sections were reviewed from each donor pancreas, and islets were counted by insulin immunopositivity (Ins+, Ins−) and insulitis status (CD3−, CD3+). Screening for insulitic islets was performed on CD3+ glucagon–stained sections. An islet was defined as ≥10 α-cells. Insulitis was defined as an islet with six or more CD3+ cells immediately adjacent to or within the islet with three or more islets per pancreas section. Percent insulitis is calculated as sum insulitic islets: (Ins+ CD3+ and Ins− CD3+)/total islets
CampbellThompson16_2	Immune cell quantification	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2016)		Numbers of CD45+, CD3+, CD20+, CD8+, and CD4+ cells were counted for each insulitic islet and averaged per donor (2–10 islets/donor).
CampbellThompson16_3	Quantification of beta-cell and alpha-cell area and mass	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2016)		Insulin- and glucagon-immunopositive areas were determined using the IHC sections to estimate β-cell and α-cell areas, respectively, in relation to total tissue area using a single Aperio colocalization algorithm (22). An average of six sections was used per donor (two sections/head, body, and tail regions). The β-cell and α-cell areas were expressed as a ratio (percent) to the total sectional area, including acinar and interstitial regions, to permit the use of pancreata weights. The average β-cell and α-cell area per pancreas was calculated from regional area averages. The β-cell or α-cell mass (in milligrams) was calculated by multiplication of the respective average area and pancreas weight (in grams).

CampbellThompson12_1	Autoantibody screening	ELISA	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2012)		nPOD screening labs utilized a modified, rapid ELISA kit (Kronus, Star, ID) with internal standard curve and recorded results as either positive or negative. The screening laboratory was responsible for contacting the OPO coordinators when positive. If the organ donor was autoantibody positive, nPOD was contacted by the OPO for research placement. As part of the quality assurance process, an aliquot of the positive screening serum sample was reanalyzed with a Kronus ELISA kit in Gainesville FL, and at the autoantibody core for GADA, IA-2A, mIAA, and ZnT8A by radioligand-binding assay (RIA) as previously described (7).
CampbellThompson12_2	Histopathological analyses	immunohistochemistry	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2012)		Six pancreas (two from each region) and one spleen paraffin block from each donor were serially sectioned and stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry. Two double immunohistochemistry stains were used to identify cell replication (Ki67) and β-cells (insulin), or T cell infiltration (CD3) and alpha cells (glucagon) according to published methods (14). Histopathological review was conducted with an emphasis on islet morphology, size, and numbers, alpha- and β-cell composition, and presence of inflammation (i.e., insulitis, pancreatitis). Insulitis was distinguished by the presence of 6 or more CD3+ cells adjacent to or within an islet. Stained slides were digitized by whole slide scanning using an Aperio CS scanner and were organized by each donor using the Spectrum Plus information management system (version 11, Aperio, Vista, CA). All paraffin blocks from the autoantibody positive donors were reviewed for the presence of insulitis following H&E staining.
CampbellThompson12_3	C-peptide laboratory analysis	radio immuno assay	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2012)		Sera obtained from the screening process and/or at donor organ recovery were analyzed by the autoantibody core. Donor C-peptide levels were determined by radioimmunoassay at the Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories (Dr. Santica Marcovina, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) with the lower limit of detection at <0.05 ng/ml.
CampbellThompson12_4	Clinical history use	clinical history	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2012)		Clinical history was obtained through current hospital admission records and the UNOS questionnaire for donation. Donors with T1D were classified based on the available clinical history (e.g., past medical history including diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-transplant HLA, medications, BMI, HbA1c levels). Autoantibody status, C-peptide levels, and the presence of high-risk HLA alleles were considered 
CampbellThompson12_5	HLA typing	major histocompatibility typing assay	Campbell-Thompson et al. (2012)		Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen spleen and quality and concentration assessed by spectrophometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was analyzed for T1D genetic susceptibility on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes at the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (Dr. Janelle Noble, Oakland, CA) using sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, as previously described (15).

Feyza14_1	Quantification of UPR mediators by relative fluorescence intensity	immunohistochemistry	Feyza et al. (2014)		Insulin positive (Ins+) β-cells were used for staining and quantification. Image analysis was performed by using custom software developed by MATLAB® (The Mathworks, Inc.). Briefly, islet regions were identified as contiguous areas (connected pixels) of insulin staining (green channel) at or above a threshold intensity value optimized across multiple images. Data acquisition was automated, and mean fluorescence intensity for insulin (green channel) and for either sXBP1, ATF6 or P-eIF2α (red channel) was calculated as the sum of intensities for all pixels divided by the number of pixels within the islet.
Freeby12_1	Co-localization analysis VMAT	immunohistochemistry|feature extraction	Freeby et al. (2012)		Co-localization was determined by double-label direct immunofluorescent staining using anti-VMAT2 antibody conjugated to APEX™ Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) and fluorescein conjugated anti-PP or -insulin antibodies. Methods and antibody specificity are previously described.22 Background staining for insulin, VMAT2, and PP was determined for each antibody (directly-labeled antibodies) or antibody pair. Antibodies were incubated on paraffin-embedded slides overnight at 4°C with the exception of insulin (2 h at room temperature). Slides were stained on a DAPI background and analyzed within one day using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and QCapture 51 to image VMAT2, insulin and PP immunofluorescent location and co-localization. A limited amount of glucagon or somatostatin co-staining with VMAT2 was performed and confirmed not to co-localize.
Cheung14_1	Quantification and co-localization analysis of B7H4	immunohistochemistry	Cheung et al. (2014)		For single-marker bright-field IHC, pancreatic islet endocrine α (glucagon+), β (insulin+), and/or δ (somatostatin+) cells and other marker protein localization was carried out by incubation with the following primary antibodies: insulin (1/100 dilution, Accurate Lab, Westbury, NY), glucagon (1/500 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada), somatostatin (1/200 dilution, Cell Marque, Rocklin, Calif), B7-H4 (mouse clone H74, 1 μg/mL, eBiosciences, San Diego, Calif), and goat polyclonal antibody (1 μg/mL, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn). An avidin-biotin-chromogen immunoperoxidase staining protocol was used with a Super Stain kit (ID Labs, London, ON, Canada) for antibodies of mouse or rabbit origin. For goat primary antibody, the second antibody was replaced with biotin-labeled anti-goat second antibody. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogenic substrate. Matched rabbit, goat, or mouse IgG or IgG subtypes served as isotype controls for the appropriate primary antibody. Detection of B7-H4 marker required antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.  To examine the tissue distribution of the marker proteins, digital images were captured by a Nikon DS-Fi1 color-chilled digital camera head attached to a Nikon Eclipse 55i upright microscope. Relative marker expression levels on captured images were analyzed using NIS-ELEMENT AR image-analysis software. Human pancreas sections were dual/triple stained with multiple fluorophores, first with anti–B7-H4 antibody revealed with FITC (green), followed by anti-insulin revealed with phycoerythrin (PE, red), and then by anti-glucagon revealed with coumarin fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (AMCA, blue) with proper blocking reagents, according to the multi-antibody/fluorophore staining protocol from Vector Laboratory (Burlingame, Calif). Multichannel fluorescence digital images were captured as described previously. The level of colocalization between 2 markers (B7-H4/insulin, B7-H4/glucagon, insulin/glucagon, and B7-H4/somatostatin) in an islet or in a region of interest, for example, in a single cell, was expressed as colocalization coefficient Pearson r. For translation of relative marker expression levels in the cells into quantitative values, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of a single bright-staining cell (average area, 75 μm2) was evaluated from each islet, and the MFI value would represent the marker expression level of that islet. Five to 10 islets from each sample were measured; thus, a representative and quantitative expression level from each marker can be compared.
Jurczyk16_1	Analysis of DISC1 mRNA expression	in-situ hybridization assay	Jurczyk et al. (2016)		For in situ hybridization (ISH), human paraffin sections from Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes pediatric organ donors were used and ISH was performed according to manufacturer’s recommendations (RNAScope, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, San Francisco, CA, USA). Amplification was applied as recommended followed by counterstaining with Gill Hemoxylin and coverslipping with Cytoseal (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Colocalization with insulin was determined in one donor using the ISH procedure as described without coverslipping before immunofluorescence detection of insulin.
Gardner13_1	AIRE-staining	immunohistochemistry	Gardner et al. (2013)		Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of human pancreatic and non-pancreatic lymph nodes from non-diabetic control patients were obtained from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with diabetes (nPOD).  After deparaffinizing and rehydrating, heat-induced antigen unmasking was performed using 1mM EDTA .  Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 1% H2O2 in PBS. Staining for AIRE was done using the anti-human AIRE antibody clone 6.1 (a generous gift from P. Peterson) and the TSA plus TMR kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts).  The secondary was either a goat anti-mouse IgG-biotinylated antibody (Vector, Burlingame, California) followed by streptavidin-HRP or the Vector anti-mouse Ig ImmPress polymer reagent.  Co-stains were done after AIRE-staining was complete.  For MHC class II, sections were first blocked with the Mouse-on-Mouse (M.O.M.) reagent (Vector, Burlingame, California), stained with anti-HLA-DP, DQ, DR (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and detected using a FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pennsylvania).  We also used the following antibodies for co-staining: CD11c (EP1347Y), CD11b (EP1345Y), CD45 (HI30).

Holm18_1	Analysis of sphingolipid-related genes	microarray assay	Holm et al. (2018)		Frozen tissue (optimal cutting temperature [OCT]) sections were obtained from the nPOD [18] and DiViD tissue collections. Tissue slides were fixed and laser-capture of islets conducted as previously described [19]. All islets in two to five sections of tissue from each donor were captured and pooled and RNA extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). Quality and quantity of RNA was determined on a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples with sufficient quantity and quality of RNA were then subjected to gene expression analysis using Affymetrix expression arrays (GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST) and scaled normalised gene expression values produced as previously described [20]. The normalised expression data for 70 genes of interest were then subjected to analysis as described below.
