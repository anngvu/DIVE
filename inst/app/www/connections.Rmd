What you see is a representation of nPOD investigator network studies being connected by shared donor samples. Each node represents a study, with size proportional to the amount of data generated, and edges proportional to the number of cases. Hovering over a study node will also show its *eigenvector centrality score*, which is described as "a measure of the influence of a node in a network". In this context, the scores point out which studies have been most active in using the nPOD repository and have high potential for additional discovery synergy.
