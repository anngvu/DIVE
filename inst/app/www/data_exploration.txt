1	#matrixOutput	<strong>The correlation matrix shows the correlation between experimental variables (from different studies) that share a subset of nPOD cases.</strong> The underlying data come from small-scale independent experiments that  may have been focused on similar or different questions. (For high-throughout data, there is a separate module in the main menu navigation). By intersecting the data, we can look for measurements from one investigation that show an interesting relationship with others in a separate investigation. <strong>Try this by clicking on a cell to see the underlying data points.</strong>	right
2	#drilldownOutput	<strong>This portal drills down to the individual-level data for a variable/relationship of interest.</strong> Alongside exploratory interaction with the correlationship matrix, the select menu allows you to select variables more specifically. Either one-dimensional or two-dimension variable views are available: when only one variable is selected, the variable is viewed across donor types; when two variables are selected, their possible relationship is visualized in a scatter plot.	left
3	#matrixCtrlUI	<strong>Use these filters to control what is shown in the correlation matrix</strong>, which can be overwhelming at full scale. Set a more stringent sample size (larger shared subset of nPOD cases) for displaying correlations, or focus on other attributes. Additional data annotations allow for more filtering methods. For example, choose filter by “cell/tissue origin” to see options in the selection menu as well as in the visual search map.	bottom
4	#cor-upload-dataUploadUI	<strong>Data can tell a better story when placed in the bigger picture.</strong> If you have new data (or even old unpublished data), running a comparison against the cumulative collection can: <li>help support results (by showing that yours are consistent with other similar data )</li> <li>reveal unexpected connections (a strong correlation with a very different variable measured elsewhere) that can lead to new hypotheses</li><br>Note that this does depend on whether there is a large enough overlapping subset of nPOD cases. The dividends of this tool will increase as more investigators contribute data and increase coverage across nPOD cases. Here you can simulate an example upload.	bottom
