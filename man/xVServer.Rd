\title{Shiny module server for presenting high dimensional data with other features in multi-column view}
\usage{
xVServer(
  id,
  hdata,
  cdata = reactive(NULL),
  key = "ID",
  selected = reactive(NULL),
  height = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Character ID for specifying namespace, see \code{shiny::\link[shiny]{NS}}.}

\item{hdata}{A numeric matrix with row and column names for heatmap representation.}

\item{cdata}{Optional, a \code{data.table} of characteristics data. See details.}

\item{key}{Name of key column for \code{cdata}, currently defaults to "ID".}

\item{selected}{A reactive vector used to subset the features (cols) of \code{hdata}.}

\item{height}{Height for data plots.}
}
\description{
Integratively visualize a high-dimensional expression dataset with phenotype or clinical features
}
\details{
The data objects here can be compared to \code{Biobase::ExpressionSet} objects,
where \code{hdata} corresponds to a (transposed) \code{exprs} matrix in the \code{assayData} slot and
\code{cdata} corresponds to the data in the \code{phenoData} slot.

The capabilities implemented are clustering (of samples by features only) and data subsetting of.
The data subsetting of expression data works through a local selection, which takes precedence
when activated, or through whatever is passed into \code{selected}.
