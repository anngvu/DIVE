\description{
Shiny module UI for controlling multi-column view
}
\details{
Multiple high dimensional datasets can be displayed by calling separate instances of \code{\link{multiVUI}} modules,
with the contents typically laid out in separate a row containers. This "controller" UI establishes three different ways to
select and source the datasets:
\enumerate{
  \item Selecting from available pre-processed datasets.
  \item User-uploaded data.
  \item A beta (least-supported) method of retrieving datasets from GEO.
}
For convenience and customization, it is possible make unavailable any of the three sourcing methods,
e.g. hide the GEO method by not displaying the UI.
