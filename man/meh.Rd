\description{
Bring up a modal dialog for application errors
}
\details{
Internally, errors in module code summon a dialog when execution fails or
when something is not allowed, etc.
Indeed, this defaults to a generic "something went wrong" message,
but the caller can provide more specific verbiage.
When the \code{dev_mode} option is set, the original error will also be displayed.
The footer can optionally contain a link to where the user can file issues,
set globally for all error modals with \code{base::options(DIVE.error.modal.footer = ui)},
or the caller can pass in custom ui.
