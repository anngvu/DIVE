\usage{
matrixCtrlServer(
  id,
  M = NULL,
  N = NULL,
  P = NULL,
  cutoffP = 0.05,
  cdata = NULL,
  metadata = NULL,
  vkey = NULL,
  newdata = reactive({ }),
  widgetmod = NULL,
  widgetopt = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Character ID for specifying namespace, see \code{shiny::\link[shiny]{NS}}.}

\item{M}{A data matrix, e.g. a correlation matrix, which must have row and column names.}

\item{N}{A matrix of the same dimensions as M to be used as a filter layer, e.g. sample size.}

\item{P}{A matrix of the same dimensions as M to be used as a filter layer, e.g. p-values.}

\item{cutoffP}{A cutoff value in `P` to be used as initial default for filtering.}

\item{cdata}{The data used for generating the matrix,
necessary for allowing user-uploaded data for mutable M.}

\item{metadata}{Optional, a data.table with different types of metadata/annotation to be used as filters.
If not given, the only filter option will be the row names in M. Column names will be the names of the filter group.}

\item{vkey}{The column in metadata that maps to row/col names in M, i.e. the key column such as VarID.
If metadata is not given, should be something like "Name" because the only selection possible is by row names.}

\item{newdata}{Optional, reactive data such as a user upload passed in by
the \code{\link{dataUploadServer}} module or from some other component,
that is suitable for merging with \preformatted{cdata} to calculate a new M.}

\item{widgetmod}{Not currently implemented. Optional widget extension module.}

\item{widgetopt}{Not currently implemented. Options for `widgetmod`.}
}
\value{
Reactive values in \code{mstate} object that keeps track of visible matrices
and selected metadata and is used by the associated plotting module.
}
\description{
Update matrix data and metadata for the appropriate plotting module.
}
\details{
What is available as filters relies on the underlying metadata.
The metadata should be a table that can be passed into the parameter
\preformatted{metadata}, with a key column referencing the matrix index
and additional columns for each type of metadata attribute.
The base UI implements interactive filters as drop-down selections.
The server function returns the data with user-applied filters,
i.e. the main input to be visualized with \code{\link{matrixMainServer}}.
}
\section{To-do}{

The UI can also expand/integrate with an optional "add-on" widget
to provide an alternate, perhaps more intuitive interface for filtering.
For example, compared to a drop-down selection of geographical locations,
a map widget would provide a better selection interface. Not all types of metadata
can be integrated with a widget, and the module provides capability for only one widget.
The server function needs to return when the widget should be called (displayed).
