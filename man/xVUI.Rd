\title{Shiny module UI for cross-view of multidimensional data}
\usage{
xVUI(id, extension = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Character ID for specifying namespace, see \code{shiny::\link[shiny]{NS}}.}

\item{extension}{Whether to include UI with extra links for calling external modules. See details.}
}
\description{
Create UI to integratively visualize an expression dataset with phenotype or clinical features
}
\details{
The UI is based on a "visual spreadsheet" or "line up" view.
The original use case presumes the high-dimensional data to be expression data, e.g.
gene or protein expression matrices. The module's primary task is simply
to combine these two data types and \emph{visualize} them together
with some basic clustering and filtering options; see \code{\link{xVServer}} for more details.
However, after the initial visualization many users will want to
\emph{analyze} the data, which is a task that is handled by other modules.
The module can contain links to call these other modules,
which are conditionally rendered in the control panel depending on the parameter \code{extension}.
If the extension is rendered, \code{returndata} should be specified for the server function
so that the module can pass the current data to these other modules.
