\title{Shiny server module function for returning a subsetted dataset}
\usage{
refSubset(input, output, session, refData, subsetfeat, refkey,
  exclude = reactive({ }), infoRmd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input, output, session}{Standard \code{shiny} boilerplate.}

\item{refData}{The reference data.table.}

\item{subsetfeat}{The name of the column containing subset factors.}

\item{refkey}{Optional, a named list containing name/label for creating a key-like column,
where the name is the name of the column. See details for intended purpose.}

\item{exclude}{Optional, a list of IDs to exclude.}

\item{infoRmd}{Optional, relative path to an info Rmarkdown file that can be pulled up in a modal.}
}
\value{
A reactive subsetted data.table.

\description{
Server function for creating a reactive subsetted dataset following user interaction.
}
\details{
When many instances of the module are used to create subsets from different datasets
(as opposed to different subsets from the same dataset), it might be necessary to use refkey
to track the dataset origin of the subset, and especially if the subsets are to be merged
on some common column. Generically speaking, datasets can come from different sources/locations,
so refkey can be called "Source" and the values might then be S1 and S2.

On the other hand, when this is used to create subsets from the same dataset,
an "exclude list" can be passed in to make sure that the subset doesn't contain
certain indices/IDs. This is desirable for creating subsets that don't overlap
with another or for filtering out rows that don't pass some criteria.
