\description{
This assembles the logic of various module components into a working one-page application.
First, the module calls \code{\link{multiVCtrl}},
which returns a named list object which either contains data or NULL.
A section is either dynamically added for data or removed for NULL,
using the name of the object, which is something like "i1" and corresponds to the
index of the stored global datasets. Thus, a section with id containing "-i1" corresponds to
a representation of the first dataset. Each section is rendered by \code{\link{xV}}.
}
\details{
While \code{\link{multiVCtrl}} is a global control that calls one or more sections into
existence on the page, there are two other types of global controls that affect
the sections present. These are the \code{\link{geneV}} and \code{\link{selectV}} controls,
which function as global filters for attributes that should be present in all or most of the data
(for expression matrix data, this means gene/protein and attributes corresponding to samples).
Thus, each \code{\link{xV}} section component listens to
\code{\link{geneV}} and \code{\link{selectV}} outputs.

However, each section also has its own local options that control display of only that section,
as seen in \code{\link{xVUI}}.
