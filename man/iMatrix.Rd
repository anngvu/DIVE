\title{Server module server for plotting correlations matrix with drilldown interaction}
\usage{
iMatrix(input, output, session, state, factorx = NULL, dcolors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input, output, session}{Standard \code{shiny} boilerplate.}

\item{state}{Reactive state object from \code{\link{matrixCtrl}}.}

\item{factorx}{Names and/or patterns for variables that should be displayed as factors in scatterplot.}

\item{dcolors}{Optional, a list of at least one categorical variable to use for scatterplot point colors
and the manual color mappings for each in the list. If color mappings are not specified, random colors will be used.}
}
\description{
The matrix responds to inputs, new plotdata, and has a linked drilldown component.
}
\details{
The module handles interactive display of a matrix linked to a scatterplot
that accesses underlying data for a user-clicked cell. It works with \code{\link{matrixCtrl}},
which returns the reactive matrix as part of a \code{state} object. The general idea is that
this module only handles visualization of a matrix while the actual matrix generation can be handled by
other modules that feed into it. For the drilldown component that displays underlying data points,
the type of data matters and may require setting aesthetic parameters to maintain consistency across modules.
