# DIVE: Data Integration & Visual Exploration

DIVE is an R/Shiny application that provides a proof-of-concept framework for curating, integrating and visualizing heterogenous biological data that has been generated from the same collection of samples, i.e. from a biorepository that distributes cells/tissues to many different investigators. Though this framework is meant to be re-purposeable as much as possible for different collections/use cases, the original and illustrative data comes from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD). This is still a work in progress and more details will be available in the paper.     

## Modules

DIVE is composed of several stand-alone modules, each with different purposes and methods for interfacing with data. 

### Cohort matching

### Exploration of data from small-throughput experiments

### Exploration of high-throughput data

### Search, summary, and download
