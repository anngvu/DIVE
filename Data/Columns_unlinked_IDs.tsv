PMID24514745		Feyza et al. (2014)	ATF6	Protein												Relative Fluorescence Intensity (RFI)				Significant decrease in ATF6a in the islets of T2D				Pancreas sections from non-diabetic and diabetic patients were obtained from nPOD and co-stained with anti-ATF6α (red), and anti-insulin (green) antibodies (upper panel) and 10–20 islets per sample were quantified by MATLAB					Figure 3. Expression of UPR mediators in the islets of type 2 diabetic humans.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920274/figure/f3/
PMID24514745		Feyza et al. (2014)	sXBP1	Protein												Relative Fluorescence Intensity (RFI)				Significant decrease in sXBP1 expression in the islets of T2D				Pancreas sections from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects co-stained with anti-sXBP1 (red) and anti-insulin (green) antibodies (upper panel) and 10–20 islets per sample were quantified by MATLAB					Figure 3. Expression of UPR mediators in the islets of type 2 diabetic humans.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920274/figure/f3/
PMID24514745		Feyza et al. (2014)	PeIF2a	Protein												Relative Fluorescence Intensity (RFI)				P-eIF2α was reduced in the islets of most T2D donors				Pancreas sections from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects co-stained with anti-P-eIF2α (red) and anti-insulin (green) antibodies (upper panel) and 10–20 islets per sample per time point were quantified by MATLAB					Figure 3. Expression of UPR mediators in the islets of type 2 diabetic humans.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920274/figure/f3/
PMID23221614		Freeby et al. (2012)	VMAT1	Protein											VMAT2 specificity for beta cells in sub-regions of the human pancreas using antibodies targeting VMAT2, insulin and PP by double-label immunofluorescence					VMAT2 is expressed by insulin producing beta cells , but not by glucagon or somatostatin expressing islet cells; positron emission tomography (PET) targeting of VMAT2 was evaluated as a non-invasive tool to measure beta cell mass (BCM) in living humans. Approximately 81% and 96% (pancreatic body and tail, respectively) of VMAT2-stained cells co-localize with β cells. In the pancreatic head, VMAT2 co-localization is split evenly between insulin and PP. Specific targeting of the pancreatic body and tail using VMAT2 PET scanning may reflect BCM more accurately.										
PMID24326367		Cheung et al. (2014)	B7H4	Protein												Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)				B7-H4 protein expression in islet β cells is decreased in T1D and PDAC, but increased in insulinoma patients when compared to normal controls; the changes in B7-H4 expression are concomitant with insulin expression of beta cells.
