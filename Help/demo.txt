1	#npodgraph	<strong>The nPOD graph (a hybrid parallel coordinates plot) provides a quick visual summary of nPOD resources and the covariate data made available for matching.</strong> The covariates include standard demographic and clinical variables such as age, sex and BMI, and ones of special interest to diabetes/autoimmune disease research such as autoantibody combination/count and HLA risk scores (coming soon). Note that covariates with more missing data work less well for matching. Hovering on a node of a categorical axis gives an additional breakdown of cohort composition. Overall, the graph is meant to give an idea of the capabilities and limitations of matching using the nPOD cohort. Click “Next” to see how this works with example data.	bottom
2	#cohortInput	As an effort to serve and promote collaboration with diabetes researchers outside of nPOD, the cohort matching tool provides an easy interface to match an outside independent cohort (“CohortX”) with nPOD. Investigators with nPOD cases can also use it to match to other nPOD cases (make sure the checkbox on the right is unchecked from the default). The uploaded data needs to be prepared as described in “Data requirements”, where the dataset <code>ExampleCohort2020</code> is provided as an example. <strong>Enter the dataset name in the cohort name/label field or simply click “Next” to start a demo match session.</strong>	auto
3	#nPODInput	<strong>After uploading cohort data and before selecting parameters, the type of nPOD matches desired should be specified.</strong> The two most common use cases are probably: 1) you have a set of T1D cases and would like non-diabetic matches from the nPOD pool to represent <em>negative controls</em>, or 2) you have a set of T1D cases and would like to get nPOD T1D matches to represent <em>positive controls or a validation cohort</em>. The demo will proceed with the second use case.	right
4	#matchUI	<strong>The match parameters UI allows intuitive user setting of how two cohort datasets should be harmonized and parameterized for matching.</strong> The selection necessarily depends on the use case determined in the previous step. In this demo, use the UI to select “Age”, “Sex” and “BMI”, then click “Match”.	right
5	#matchResult	<strong>The main result of matching is shown here.</strong> The full table of match results can be downloaded using the “Export” button. Navigate to the other tab to see summary statistics. Click “Next” to learn about advanced exploration.	right
6	#advancedMatchResult	nPOD cases have been richly characterized, and though these other attributes are not considered covariates for matching, investigators can know whether a particular attribute has been measured and view the partial data. For “comparable” attributes that capture the same or nearly the same concept/process but were not measured with the same scale or method, the cohorts are compared side by side in separate plots. <strong>Select the attribute “” in CohortX to see this example.</strong>	left
7	#advancedMatchResult	It is possible that the data are already on the same scale or can be transformed to be on the same scale using a mapping or normalization function. For example, “HLA Risk” is. Check “Plot on same scale” and enter in “ “. This will be applied on CohortX data values.
