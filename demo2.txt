1	#corM	The correlation matrix shows all correlation between variables that share a subset of nPOD cases. The data come from many small-scale independent experiments mostly focused on different questions. Nevetheless, a measurement from one investigation can show an interesting relationship with another in a separate investigation. <strong>Click on a cell to see the underlying data points.</strong>	right
2	#drilldown	This module drills down to the individual-level data for a variable/relationship of interest. Either one-dimensional or two-dimension variable views are available. Explore data for certain variables/relationships by interacting with the correlationship matrix or by using the menu to search and select.	left
3	#corrFilters	Use these filters to control what is shown in the correlation matrix. Set a more stringent sample size (larger shared subset of nPOD cases) for displaying correlations, or focus only on variables within some category or publication.	bottom
4	#corrUpload	Data can tell a better story when placed in the bigger picture. If you have new data (or even old unpublished data), running a comparison against the cumulative database can: <li>help support results (by showing that yours are consistent with other similar data )</li> <li>reveal unexpected connections (a strong correlation with a very different variable measured elsewhere) that lead to new hypotheses</li><li>give you a better sense of how your data contributes in the history of nPOD</li><br>Note that this does depend on whether there is large enough overlapping subset of nPOD cases. The realization of this tool will improve as more investigators contribute data and there is more coverage across nPOD cases.	bottom
