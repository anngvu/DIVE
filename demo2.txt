1	#corM	The correlation matrix shows all correlation between variables that share a subset of nPOD cases. The data come from many small-scale independent experiments mostly focused on different questions. Yet a measurement from one investigation may show an interesting relationship with another in a separate investigation. <strong>Click on a cell to see the underlying data points.</strong>	right
2	#drilldown	This module drills down to the individual-level data for a variable/relationship of interest. Either one-dimensional or two-dimension variable views are available. Explore data for certain variables/relationships by interacting with the correlationship matrix or by using the menu to search and select.	left
3	#corrFilters	Use these filters to control what is shown in the correlation matrix. Set a more stringent sample size (larger shared subset of nPOD cases) for displaying correlations, or focus only on variables within some category or criteria.	bottom
4	#corrUpload	Data can tell a better story when provided more context. Comparison of your data, i.e. unpublished measurements, with the past cumulative data can: <li>help support results (by showing that they are consistent with data for a similar variable)</li> or <li>reveal unexpected connections (a strong correlation with a very different variable measured elsewhere) that provide leads to a new story.</li><br><br>Note that this does depend on whether there is large enough overlapping subset of nPOD cases. See the guide for what your upload should look like.	bottom
